description: Test your front-end against a real API. A hosted REST-API ready to respond
  to your AJAX requests. It might seem pretty weird to be sending your data to a 3rd
  party API, but I can assure you, Reqres does not store any of your data at all.
  Once you send it to us, we just send it straight back...and then its gone!
